              <h3>PhD Candidate in Bioengineering</h3>
                <p>Breanne Przestrzelski is a University Innovation Fellow at Clemson University where she is pursuing her PhD in Bioengineering with a focus on innovation of biomedical devices and translation thereof through immersion of bioengineers in design and entrepreneurship opportunities.  The University Innovation Fellowship, which is a program of Epicenter and a joint-venture of VentureWell and Stanford University, has inspired Breanne to share her passion for design and entrepreneurship through a variety of initiatives she is helping to bring to Upstate South Carolina, one of which is through the innovative and game-based learning she is implementing in her role as co-instructor for the Bioengineering Senior Design class.  Breanne obtained her B.S. in May 2012 (research focus: nanomedicine technology) and her M.S. degree in August 2013 (research focus: glenoid loading and stability of the inlay verus onlay shoulder system) both from the Clemson University bioengineering department.</p>

              <h2>John Leininger, Ph.D.</h2>
              <h3>Professor in Graphic Communications</h3>
                <p>John Leininger has been a Professor of Graphic Communications at Clemson University for 28 years. His focus had been in print design and production, but as digital printing became practical and cost effective in the last decade he began to work with “Variable Data Printing” (VDP). The natural evolution was to combine mailing into his instructional plan. As the process continued, direct mail and marketing strategies became a foundation of all his teaching. The last four summers he has taught a class on “Mailing, Fulfillment and Marketing Services” as an on-campus class, distance learning class and industry webinar series.</p><p>

John speaks at conferences throughout the year (including events like the National Postal Forum, Document Strategy Forum, On-Demand, Graph Expo, etc.) on variable data, database development, mailing and marketing services. His current research is focused on evaluating print design strategies with eye tracking software, marketing analytics through web tracking portals and using QR codes and hidden watermarks as marketing tools. Seven years ago John created the VDP Traveling Laptop Training Consortium and has conducted hands-on training across the country over 100 times. The training has showed over 1,600 people how to work with VDP and to maximize response rates and to optimize mail piece design to work within the USPS rules and regulations. Like his teaching, John’s training and presentation strategy reflects the philosophy in the Clemson University Department of Graphic Communication’s Mission Statement: To develop dedicated, practical problem solving people for the printing, publishing, imaging, packaging and allied industries.</p>
